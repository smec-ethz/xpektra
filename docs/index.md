##  Getting Started
**Xpektra** is a framework for spectral methods written entirely in Python. It is designed to be a modular and easy to use framework for spectral methods. **Xpektra** is designed to be high-performance and scalable, capable of running on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. The features of **Xpektra** are:

- runnable on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs
- modular and easy to use
- fully differentiable

**Xpektra** is built on top of the differentiable libraries such as  **JAX** and **PyTorch**. 


## Installation

```bash
pip install xpektra
```
